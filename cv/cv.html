      Kutahn is an image maker based in Seoul.<br>
      He primarily creates, deconstructs, and synthesizes images. <br>
      His work explores the idea that subjects are perceived as <br>
      singular images within an image space and from this, <br>
      he aims to create "easy-to-eat" visuals.<br>

          Kutahn explores the environments and conditions<br>
          under which images are produced and circulated.<br>
          He is particularly interested in the subtle contexts<br>
          behind visual forms. He often begins by tracing<br>
          unseen or background materials to generate<br>
          something new.<br>
          <br>
          Since 2023, he has been studying Visual<br>
          Communication Design and Art Theory at<br>
          Hongik University. His focus spans graphic design,<br>
          web, video, typography, installation, 3D,<br>
          performance, and art direction.<br>
          <br>
          Proficient in developing visual concepts and<br>
          articulating them through diverse visual languages,<br>
          he is deeply engaged in creating images<br>
          that have never existed before.
